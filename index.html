    <h2> Hello World! <br> I am Thiago </h2>

    <h4> About Me </h4>

  <p>	
	 I am a world traveler always looking to discover and experience the unknown. My drive is curiosity and an endless quest to acquire knowledge about people, cultures, technology and developing economies.
  </p>
	
  <p>
	 Currently I am attending college to get a Master's in Software Engineering and I hold a Bachelor's in International Business. I am fluent in Portuguese and English, intermediate in Spanish. Previously, I served in the U.S. Army, interned with Bloomberg LP and traveled to fourteen countries. From my experiences, I learned how to work and communicate with people from different cultural background and think creatively to solve problems.
